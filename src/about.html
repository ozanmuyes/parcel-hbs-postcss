        The web-boilerplate's default theme is Lanyon, originally developed as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
      </p>

      {{!-- {{#markdown}}
        It comes with many great features, including:

        - Mobile friendly design and development
        - Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
        - Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
        - [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

        Find out more about Lanyon by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

        ### Browser support

        Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.
